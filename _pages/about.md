<h1>About Me</h1>
------
I am deeply passionate about reinforcement learning-based wireless network optimization and radio frequency (RF) sensing with deep learning approaches. These areas have been the focus of my work as a wireless communication and AI researcher at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member). Over the past four years, during my undergraduate and Masterâ€™s studies in Computer Science at Chosun University, I have cultivated expertise in these cutting-edge fields.

Over recent decades, wireless technology has achieved remarkable advances in frequency performance, but this progress has often come at the cost of increased energy consumption and computational complexity. To address these challenges, I have focused on optimizing wireless network resources using deep reinforcement learning to enhance spectral and energy efficiency while improving user fairness. Notably, I designed the Multi-Objective Asynchronous Advantage Single Actor-Multiple Critics (MO-A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm for massive antenna-aided base station (BS) transmission power allocation in multi-cellular networks. This work was published in _IEEE Access_ and received the Best Paper Award at _the 33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

As a research assistant, I gained extensive expertise in applying deep reinforcement learning to solve joint optimization problems, such as balancing trade-offs between spectral and energy efficiency and addressing multi-objective functions for 5G/B5G networks. I also designed and validated RF transceivers and software-defined radio (SDR)-based wireless communication testbeds, including Multi-Hop Routing algorithm, TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with advanced digital signal processing schemes. These efforts resulted in our research team publishing and presenting nine papers at international and domain-specific conferences and received the Best Paper Award at _the 2021 Winter Confernece on Korea Information and Communications Society_.

Recently, I worked on a project combining WiFi channel state information (CSI) and camera data to enhance robust object detection and motion estimation in a deep learning-aided monitoring system. I developed and validated wireless data-logging software using a TP-Link AC 1750 WiFi router and an Intel 5300 WLAN card, implementing a synchronization algorithm between 3x3 WiFi CSI and camera-captured data on Linux operating systems. Additionally, I collaborated with the [KAIST MINT Lab](http://mintlab1.kaist.ac.kr/) to develop a wireless data-logging mobile application for connecting and processing multimodal near-field communication (NFC) chip data. This wireless data-logging scheme is set to be published in Nature Communications in collaboration with KAIST MINT Lab.

Finally, I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results in wireless communication simulation and testbed development through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO), fostering open collaboration and knowledge sharing.
