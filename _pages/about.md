<h1>About Me</h1>
------

I am deeply passionate about reinforcement learning-based network optimization, RF sensing for smart healthcare, and multimodal AI. These areas define my focus as a wireless communication and AI researcher at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member). Over the past four years, spanning my undergraduate and Master's studies in Computer Science at Chosun University, I have worked on optimizing wireless network resources and enhancing efficiency using reinforcement learning algorithms, including designing the multi-objective asynchronous advantage single actor-multiple critics (MO-A3Cs) algorithm for transmission power allocation.

As a research assistant, I gained expertise in deep reinforcement learning to solve complex decision-making problems. I also designed wireless testbeds, including Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based communication systems that involved LabVIEW FPGA modules for digital signal processing and RF sensing-based smart healthcare solutions, which include BLE, NFC, and WiFi signals. My recent project combined WiFi signals and camera data to enhance object detection and motion tracking for healthcare applications. Additionally, I collaborated with the [KAIST MINT Lab](http://mintlab1.kaist.ac.kr/) to develop data-logging software for multimodal NFC chips.

Lastly, I am sharing my research methodologies and results through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO).
