<h1>About Me</h1>
------
I am deeply passionate about reinforcement learning-based wireless network optimization and radio frequency (RF) sensing with deep learning approaches. These areas have been the cornerstone of my work as a wireless communication and AI researcher at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member). During my undergraduate and Masterâ€™s studies in Computer Science at Chosun University, I have cultivated expertise in these cutting-edge fields.

Wireless technology has achieved remarkable advancements in frequency performance, yet these gains often come with increased energy consumption and computational complexity. To tackle these challenges, I designed the Multi-Objective Asynchronous Advantage Single Actor-Multiple Critics (MO-A3C) reinforcement learning algorithm for massive antenna-aided base station (BS) transmission power allocation in multi-cellular networks. This work, published in _IEEE Access_, received the Best Paper Award at the _33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

As a research assistant, I gained extensive expertise in applying reinforcement learning to optimize wireless networks, balancing trade-offs between spectral and energy efficiency while addressing multi-objective functions for 5G/B5G networks. I also designed and validated RF transceivers and software-defined radio (SDR)-based wireless communication testbeds, including Multi-Hop Routing algorithms, TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with advanced digital signal processing techniques. These efforts resulted in nine published papers at international and domain-specific conferences, including a Best Paper Award at the _2021 Winter Conference on Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_.

One of my recent projects focused on integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI) and camera data to improve object detection and motion estimation in deep learning-aided monitoring systems. I developed wireless data-logging software using a TP-Link AC 1750 WiFi router and an Intel 5300 WLAN card, implementing synchronization algorithms between 3x3 WiFi CSI and camera-captured data on Linux systems. Collaborating with the [KAIST MINT Lab](http://mintlab1.kaist.ac.kr/), I also developed a wireless data-logging mobile application for connecting and processing multimodal near-field communication (NFC) chip data. This work is being prepared for publication in _Nature Communications_.

Lastly, I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results in wireless communication simulation and testbed development through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO), fostering open collaboration and knowledge sharing.
