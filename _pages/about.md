<h1>About Me :&#41;</h1>
------
I am deeply passionate about designing and validating Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based RF simulators/testbeds, and optimizing them using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Over two years as an undergraduate intern and during my M.S. studies at the <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Smart Networking Lab (SNL)</a> in Computer Science at Chosun University, I gained extensive experience in wireless communication system design and optimization.

To address challenges in energy consumption and computational complexity in modern and emerging wireless networks, I focused on leveraging RL to optimize resource allocation while balancing trade-offs among spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and user fairness. Specifically, I designed a multi-objective RL (MORL) algorithm for optimizing transmission power allocation in massive antenna-aided base stations (BS) across multi-cellular networks, achieving joint optimization of these critical performance metrics. This work, published in _IEEE Access_, received the Best Paper Award at _the 33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

I also designed and validated RF simulators, SDR-based transceivers, including TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with advanced digital signal processing techniques. These efforts resulted in nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, including the Best Paper Award at _the 2021 Winter Conference on Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_. I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results through my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube channel</a> and <a href="https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>, fostering global collaboration and advancing innovations in wireless communication technologies.

<!-- My research journey continues as I join <a href="https://hlklemove.com/eng/main.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">HL Klemove</a> in March 2025 to contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving solutions. -->
