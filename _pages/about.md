# About Me :&#41;

I am deeply passionate about designing and validating Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based RF simulators/testbeds, and optimizing them using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Over two years as an undergraduate intern and during M.S. studies at [_Smart Networking Lab_](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in Dept. of Computer Science at Chosun University, I gained extensive experience in wireless communication system design and optimization.

To address challenges in energy consumption and computational complexity in modern and emerging wireless networks, I focused on leveraging RL to optimize resource allocation while balancing trade-offs among spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and user fairness. Specifically, I designed a multi-objective RL (MORL) algorithm for optimizing transmission power allocation in massive antenna-aided base stations (BS) across multi-cellular networks, achieving joint optimization of these critical performance metrics. This work, published in _IEEE Access_, received the Best Paper Award at _the 33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

I also designed and validated RF simulators, SDR-based transceivers, including TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with advanced digital signal processing techniques. These efforts resulted in nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, including the Best Paper Award Winner at _the 2021 Winter Conference on Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_. I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results through my [_YouTube_](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} and [_GitHub_](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}, fostering global collaboration and advancing innovations in wireless communication technologies.

My research journey continues as I join <a href="https://hlklemove.com/eng/main.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_HL Klemove_</a> in March 2025, contributing to the advancement of autonomous driving solutions.
