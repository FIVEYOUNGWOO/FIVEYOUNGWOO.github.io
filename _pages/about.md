<h1>About Me</h1>
------
I am deeply passionate about designing and validating Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based wireless networks and optimizing them using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Over two years as an undergraduate intern and during my M.S. studies at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member) in Computer Science at Chosun University, I have developed expertise in wireless communications.

Wireless technology has achieved remarkable advancements in frequency performance, yet these gains often come with increased energy consumption and computational complexity. To address these challenges, my work focuses on leveraging the RL to optimize wireless resource allocation while balancing trade-offs among spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and user fairness. Specifically, I designed a multi-objective RL (MORL) algorithm for transmission power allocation in massive antenna-aided base stations (BS) across multi-cellular networks, achieving joint optimization of these critical performance metrics. This work, published in _IEEE Access_ SCI(E) journal, received the Best Paper Award at the _33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

I also designed and validated SDR-based transceivers, including TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with digital signal processing. These efforts resulted in nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, including the Best Paper Award at the _2021 Winter Conference on Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_.

Lastly, I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results in wireless communication simulation and testbed development through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO), fostering open collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

<!-- One of my recent projects focused on integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI) and camera data to improve object detection and motion estimation in deep learning-aided monitoring systems. I developed wireless data-logging software using a TP-Link AC 1750 WiFi router and an Intel 5300 WLAN card, implementing synchronization algorithms between 3x3 WiFi CSI and camera-captured data on Linux systems. Collaborating with the [KAIST MINT Lab](http://mintlab1.kaist.ac.kr/), I also developed a wireless data-logging mobile application for connecting and processing multimodal near-field communication (NFC) chip data. This work is being prepared for publication in _Nature Communications_. -->
