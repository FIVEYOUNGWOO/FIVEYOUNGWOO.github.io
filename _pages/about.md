# About Me :&#41;


I am deeply passionate about designing and validating Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based RF simulators and wireless communication testbeds, as well as optimizing them using reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. Over four years as an undergraduate lab-intern and during my M.S. degree at [_Smart Networking Lab_](https://sites.google.com/view/inl-cau/member?authuser=0#h.lo5cx1xeqvz){:target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"} in the Department of _Computer Engineering_ at _Chosun University_, I gained extensive experience in wireless system design and optimization.

To address challenges related to energy consumption and computational complexity in modern and emerging wireless networks, I focused on leveraging RL to optimize resource allocation while balancing trade-offs among spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and user fairness. Specifically, I designed a multi-objective reinforcement learning model for optimizing transmission power allocation in massive antenna-aided base stations (BS) across multi-cellular networks, achieving joint optimization of these critical performance metrics. This work was published in _IEEE Access_, received the Best Paper Award at _the 33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

I also designed and validated RF simulators and SDR-based RF transceivers, including TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems, gaining hands-on experience with various wireless communication techniques and RF-system-level design considerations. These efforts collectively led to nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, one of which received the Best Paper Award at _the 2021 Winter Conference of the Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_.

My research journey has continued at <a href="https://hlklemove.com/eng/main.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_HL Klemove_</a> since March 2025, where I contribute to the advancement of autonomous driving systems by developing a web-based, real-time sensor monitoring and visualization platform for ADAS research. The platform enables remote access to in-vehicle multi-RADAR and multi-camera sensors through a web interface, and is designed with an extensible architecture that can be expanded toward future in-vehicle infotainment systems.
