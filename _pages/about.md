<h1>About Me</h1>
------
I am deeply passionate about the validation of Software-Defined Radio (SDR)-based wireless networks and network optimization with reinforcement learning (RL) approaches. These areas are the cornerstone of my work as a wireless communication and AI researcher at the [Smart Networking Lab (SNL)](https://sites.google.com/view/smart-networking/member). I have developed expertise through two years as an undergraduate intern and subsequent M.S. studies in Computer Science at Chosun University.

Wireless technology has achieved remarkable advancements in frequency performance, yet these gains often occur with increased energy consumption and computational complexity. To address these challenges, my work focuses on leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize resource allocation while balancing trade-offs between spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, I designed the reinforcement learning algorithm for massive antenna-aided base station (BS) transmission power allocation in multi-cellular networks. This work, published in _IEEE Access_, received the Best Paper Award at _the 33rd Joint Conference on Communications and Information (JCCI)_.

I also designed and validated SDR-based transceivers, including Multi-Hop Routing algorithms, TDD/TDMA, OFDM, and MIMO systems with digital signal processing techniques. These efforts resulted in nine research papers presented at international and domestic conferences, including the Best Paper Award at _the 2021 Winter Conference on Korea Information and Communications Society (KICS)_.

Lastly, I actively share my research methodologies and experimental results in wireless communication simulation and testbed development through my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZI9JfPn_Nk6HVkl2aAj4xA) and [GitHub repository](https://github.com/FIVEYOUNGWOO), fostering open collaboration and knowledge-sharing.

<!-- One of my recent projects focused on integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI) and camera data to improve object detection and motion estimation in deep learning-aided monitoring systems. I developed wireless data-logging software using a TP-Link AC 1750 WiFi router and an Intel 5300 WLAN card, implementing synchronization algorithms between 3x3 WiFi CSI and camera-captured data on Linux systems. Collaborating with the [KAIST MINT Lab](http://mintlab1.kaist.ac.kr/), I also developed a wireless data-logging mobile application for connecting and processing multimodal near-field communication (NFC) chip data. This work is being prepared for publication in _Nature Communications_. -->
