abstract: "This paper presents a deep learning (DL)-aided human pose estimation using WiFi channel state information (CSI). The method comprises hybrid gates long short-term memory (LSTM)-gated recurrent unit (GRU) arranged in a U-Net architecture. We developed a U-Net architecture where the encoder and decoder consist of five LSTM-GRU layers. We utilized an attention connection between each encoder layer and the corresponding decoder layer to enhance the convergence of the estimation capabilities of the model. The proposed model is evaluated on our collected dataset and the case of adding white Gaussian noise to the CSI data. The results show that our proposed model outperforms the benchmark method."
