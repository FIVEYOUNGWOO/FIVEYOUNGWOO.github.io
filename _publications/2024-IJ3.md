abstract: "Diabetic ulcers are a severe complication of diabetes, often leading to infection, amputation, and increased mortality. Early detection of diabetic ulcer deterioration requires diagnosis of key biochemical indicators such as pH, glucose, and temperature to prevent wound deterioration and improve patient outcomes. Most traditional wound dressings focus solely on protection and healing but lack the ability to diagnose these critical factors. Here, a wireless, battery-free optoelectronic patch integrated with electrospun colorimetric dressings is introduced for multimodal wound monitoring. The dressing incorporates curcumin–polycaprolactone (C-PCL) and 3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine-glucoseoxidase-peroxidase-polycaprolactone (TGP-PCL)-based electrospun fiber, producing distinct colorimetric transitions in response to pH and glucose. These colorimetric diagnostic performances are quantified by measuring reflectance differences under specific wavelength light through integrated LED–photodiode pairs, respectively. Furthermore, the wireless, battery-free sensor enables continuous, real-time monitoring without causing discomfort to the patient, offering both qualitative visual feedback and quantitative data for precise self-monitoring. In vivo validation in a rat wound model demonstrated reliable detection of infection-driven alkalization, monitoring of wound temperature, and accurate glucose quantification consistent with a commercial glucometer. This platform merges intuitive visual cues with quantitative electronic outputs in a battery-free, wireless design, offering a practical and cost-effective solution for real-time and multimodal wound monitoring."
