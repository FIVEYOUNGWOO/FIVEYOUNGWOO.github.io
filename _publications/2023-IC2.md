abstract: This study leverages the unique identity of health sensors to remotely monitor patients' essential body signs. Sensor data is collected by middleware and accessible to doctors and healthcare centers, facilitating remote assistance. Data is transmitted to a mobile app via Bluetooth for easy access, enabling monitoring, visualization, and storage of vital signs. This approach improves monitoring, integration, and notifications, reducing errors and offering a novel approach for doctors. Utilizing 5G networks enhances data transmission between sensors, mobile devices, and the cloud, improving performance and reliability. Real-time monitoring empowers healthcare providers to make informed decisions promptly.
