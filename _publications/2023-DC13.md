abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) systems are generally perceived as difficult to install and maintain. In addition to this, it also carries a cost of educating the hospital personnel on using these systems. The approach we have presented in this paper presents an EHR system as a collection of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) that are lightweight, scalable, secure, and fast. Since these APIs have been developed in accordance with Representational State Transfer (REST), which is largely compatible with most other APIs available today, it can be integrated with third-party applications as well and can reduce the need to have proprietary systems and applications which will be consuming these APIs. Due to this, we can reduce the costs of educating hospital staff. In addition to this, we have created our APIs to be secure and to prevent unauthorized data access. We have also used dependencies with no vulnerabilities to prevent any security breaches in the future.
